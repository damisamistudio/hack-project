<div class="hack"> I joined with a BSc in computer science but i couldn't code to save my life. I participated in the 
    self-learning program and it changed everything for me. I met alot of great people who were always willing 
    to help out.
    ADENIYI IBUKUNOLUWA
    CEO www.mybukka.com <br>
    I joined the mentorship program with no knowledge of software development. I honestly can't explain how I 
    became a senior developer at a top IT firm in less than 6 months <br>
    JOHN ANISERE
    Senior Developer Busha LTD <br>
    Learning to code for me has been the most rewarding experience. Although I am a lawyer, it was not a 
    problem. Within 2 weeks I was already doing things I never though I was capable of. Programming changed 
    every part of my life, from the way I think to how I approach day to day life <br>
